Peer Feedback:
1. This may just be personal preference, but I feel that the bottom of the page looks empty, especially with the copyright being so high up on the page. I was thinking that it could look good with the copyright at the bottom, which would also make more space for the images and descriptive texts.

Response:
To address this feedback, I modified the CSS to adjust the `margin-top` property for the footer. This moves the copyright to the bottom of the page, filling the previously empty space.

Code change:
styles.css:
.footer {
    background-color: #483d8b;
    padding: 40px 20px;
    text-align: center;
    color: #ffffff;
    margin-top: auto; /* Ensure the footer sticks to the bottom */
}

2. The navigation menu items could have more space between them for better readability on larger screens.

Response:
I added more spacing between the navigation menu items to improve readability on larger screens by adjusting the `margin-right` property.

Code change:
styles.css:
nav ul.nav-menu li {
    margin-right: 30px; /* Increased margin for better spacing */
}
